Hi all, 

If you are interested in testing the LCS code from Daibiri group, you can use the code
in the repository (or you can download from daibiri group's page). It is a opensource matlab package.
I am trying to read the theory and understand the code. My current plan is to get used to their 
Matlab code. 

I am planning to test the effectiveness of the opensource LCS code by using a sample data set.
For the sample data, I have some LES field data, but initially I will be testing the LCS code using opensource
data obtained from ISABEL DATABASE.. available at

http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/

If feasible I will try to download and upload the database in git. But it is better that you can download the
data yourself. If you wanted to read more about LCS you can find the files in the literature folder. 
It will be a nice learning experience. I will let you know if I could fetch a software for sparse data too.
Else we can use this existing open-source version to determine the LCS. We might lose some information, but it
will be negligible (I hope). I will also work on better interpolation algorithm to account for such loss in data.
If you want you hands dirty, you can also try modifying the code. Keep posted. Good luck.
