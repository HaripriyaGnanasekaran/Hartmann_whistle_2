Hi all, 

I am planning to test the effectiveness of the opensource LCS codes taken from Daibiri webpage, 
till we get the new version of the LCS from the Delft group.

So, it is basically understanding the Matlab code and testing it with a sample data.

For the sample data, I have some LES field data, but initially I will be testing the LCS code using opensource
data obtained from ISABEL DATABASE.. available at

http://www.vets.ucar.edu/vg/isabeldata/

If feasible I will try to download and upload the database in git. But it is better that you can download the
data yourself if you want to get your hands on the LCS files.
